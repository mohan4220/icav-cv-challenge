I am using a RCNN type model that uses selective search for regional proposals.

you can download the dataset from here:

I created the pickles files using main.py script, of the training images and lables. you can download them from here:

My train.py script uses pickled image and label files to train the model. model architecture is also defined in this file.

in order to predict, use predict.py file as:
python predict.py <path to image file>

#Answers to the questions given:
1.	By changing input number of epochs, changing activation functions, choosing a suitable optimizer and loss functions.
2.	By changing number of epochs and batch size.
3.	I use tensorflow. By using tensorflowâ€™s model optimizing toolkit.
4.	Using MLQ module at the backend.
5.	Provide more data for training, data augmentation, increased number of epochs.
6.	Overfitting can be avoided by having a large dataset with unsimilar items, reducing the number of epochs.
7.	I try to split the dataset, then try to create another dataset from the given hoping to make it balanced.
8.	I feed the live image/video feed from a camera to the model, make predictions and output the results, then pass it to another node or code segment to decide what to do with the results.

Its a pretty basic model, as it uses selctive search at every stage to have regional proposes, it is slow. performance and accuracy can be increase by using a model that has region proposal mechanism build into the network like a faster RCNN.
